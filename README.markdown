Just archiving some old projects of mine.

This is the old Cyberian Soldiers Robotics Team fundraising-era Chat program,
when I was just learning how to do networking and was really excited about XML,
but really didn't know what I was doing. The code is okay, but the protocol is
a terrible melange of pseudo-XML and Java's binary Serializable format.
